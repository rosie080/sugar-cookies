  <h2>Method</h2>
  <p>Preheat oven to 180Â°C bake and grease or line two large baking trays with baking paper.
Melt butter, then add Chelsea White Sugar and Chelsea Soft Brown Sugar and cream these together. Beat in the eggs and vanilla then use a spoon or spatula to mix the dry ingredients.
Roll into medium-sized balls and place on prepared trays. They shouldn't spread too much so flatten slightly. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until lightly browned around the edges.
Leave to cool on trays for a few minutes before transferring to a wire cooling rack.</p>
